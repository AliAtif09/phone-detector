# Sample Video File

This is a placeholder for the video file that will be played when the detector triggers.

## Instructions for Users:

1. Replace this file with your own video file (MP4, AVI, MOV, etc.)
2. Update the `VIDEO_PATH` variable in `yolo_realtime.py` to point to your video file
3. Make sure the video file is in a format supported by ffpyplayer

## Example:
```python
VIDEO_PATH = "my_trigger_video.mp4"
```

## Note:
The original video files (creed.mp4, goggins.mp4, v1.mp4, etc.) are not included in this repository due to their large size. Users should provide their own video files.
